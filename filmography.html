          <p>
            Since Kim So Hyun is most known for her acting, especailly in dramas, it is important that they are covered. Even as a child, she has been a range of different genres and roles. Despite her young age, she played some really mature roles, such as 김선 Kim Sun (the queen) in 쓸쓸하고 찬란하신 – 도깨비 Guardian: The Lonely and Great God in 2016 at the age of seventeen. But she can also play more innocent roles, such as 김조조 Kim Jo-Jo in 좋아하면 울리는 Love Alarm in 2019 and 2021.
